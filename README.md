# UMStudentDashboard

Welcome to the UMStudentDashboard!
The UMStudentDashboard is an academic-performance dashboard, which calls upon the user to input class and grade data, over a period of four quarters, and allows the user to graphically represent the data. 

How to Run the Dashboard:
1. Download the .py file, known as UMStudentDashboard.py & save it in your chosen directory.
2. Open your desired terminal or command-prompt & navigate to the directory where you downloaded UMStudentDashboard.py
3. Run the script, via the following command: 'python UMStudentDashboard.py'

How to Play!:
1. Initially, the program will start by asking a user their academic school-year, student-ID, and name.
2. Following that, the program will prompt the user to input their classes for the academic year (separated by commas),before being prompted to input their grades for each class (again, separated by commas).
3. Finally, the program will prompt the user with a list of statistical ‘methods’ to perform on the data, which once    chosen, will provide meaningful graphical representation.
4. After the user is finished, the program allows the user to exit the program.

Program Limitations:
1. As of Release 1.0, the program can only conduct three statistical ‘methods’ on the data.
2. As of Release 1.0, certain edge-cases may break the program, ensure you follow directions provided by this document and the program.
