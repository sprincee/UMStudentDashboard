'''
Coding-Outline:
Summary: 
- An academic dashboard -- used primarily to run tests based on grades inputted.
Object:
- To provide a user with valuable information from which they can make academic decisions.
Parameters:
- A user will input student-ID and name only ONCE. It will be saved in memory hereafter, preventing unnecessary inputs. 
- A user will input a floating-point number, which will repersent a given alpha-character (A-F), for each subject.
- A user can only input a subject ONCE. (e.g the subject cannot appear twice.)
- A user will be prompted with types of information they'd like presented -- ONLY after they have finished inputting data/grades. (e.g asking for average-grade distribution)
- The program will provide two types of data: an average grade graph and a grade-frequency graph.
Notes:
- Taking inspiration from StudentVUE -- an app used in K-12 education.
Functions/Structural Elements:
- An empty list to store subjects -- checked for duplicates, since those are not allowed.
- An empty list to store names -- checked for duplicates, since those are not allowed.
- An empty list to store student-ID's -- checked for duplicates, since those are not allowed
A note for grading:
- I used this as an initial commit; also as a way to organize my thoughts.
- It's not all encompassing & things are probably going to change during dev cycle.
- It's just a way to get my ideas on paper (or screen, in this case).
